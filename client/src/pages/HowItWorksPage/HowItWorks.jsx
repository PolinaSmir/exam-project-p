                  For Naming contests, you will start receiving your submissions
                  within few minutes of launching your contest. Since our
                  creatives are located across the globe, you can expect to
                  receive submissions 24 X 7 throughout the duration of the
                  brainstorming phase.

                <div className={styles.answer}>
                  You can choose a duration from 1 day to 7 days. We recommend a
                  duration of 3 Days or 5 Days. This allows for sufficient time
                  for entry submission as well as brainstorming with creatives.
                  If you take advantage of our validation services such as
                  Audience Testing and Trademark Research, both will be an
                  additional 4-7 days (3-5 business days for Audience Testing

                  We offer payment plans for many domains in our Marketplace. If

                  can assist you with making any changes to the domains (such as
                  Nameserver changes), so that you can start using the domain
                  right away after making your first installment payment.

                  We are open to anyone to signup. However, we have an extensive
                  'Quality Scoring' process which ensures that high quality
                  creatives have the ability to continue to participate in the
                  platform. On the other hand, we limit the participation from
                  those creatives who do not consistently receive high ratings.

                  When you initially signup, you are assigned few contests to
                  assess your overall quality of submissions. Based upon the
                  quality of your submissions, you will continue to be assigned
                  additional contests. Once you have received enough high
                  ratings on your submissions, your account will be upgraded to
                  'Full Access', so that you can begin participating in all open
                  contests.
